# Basic Rules of Go

- Go is compiled language
- It has similarity in syntax with C, C++, C# as well as Pascal family of languages
- Initially introduced in 10 November 2009
- Case sensitive
- Tries to reduce the code a developer has to type
- Uses braces for code blocks
- No semicolons required but lexer might add those for you at end of the statements
- Go uses `mixedCase` for naming items
- If a given name starts with Capital letter - mixed case, it is equivalent to public declaration in C++ or Java
- There is no concept of classes but there are lot of structs and types and interfaces
- Requires no VM on your machine for Go to execute, as compiled code will include required runtime, hence the compiled object code may be much larger than source code as it statically links runtime into it
- Compiled code will execute on specific platform
